# Shifts-Logger ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-blue.svg)


## ✅ Given Requirements

- [x] This is an application where you should record a worker's shifts.
- [x] All validation and user input should happen in the UI app.
- [x] Your API's controller should be lean. Any logic should be handled
      in a separate "service".
- [x] You should use SQL Server, not SQLite
- [x] You should use the "code first" approach to create your database, using
      Entity Framework's migrations tool. 

## 🚀 Features

🔹 Manager-code API key needed to "authorize" the editing / deletion of shifts.




## 🔥 Challenges / Lessons Learned

  - First time making an API -> had only vaguely even heard of HTTP PUT and DELETE methods
